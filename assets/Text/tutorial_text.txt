Welcome to Heslington! You are a student at the university of York and your first big exam is fast approaching, but you haven't studied yet at all!

Over the next 7 days you will need to manage studying, eating, sleeping and relaxing.

You can study in the Computer Science building, eat in the Ron Cooke Hub, meet friends in the Piazza, and sleep in your accomodation building.

Good luck with your exam!
